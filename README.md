# Checking-Similarities
My code is designed to check similarities between 8 codes (from deid HW assignment) using two string similarity metrics (Jaro similarity and Absolute Levenshtein distance) and a Universal Sentence Similarity metric.

8 pieces of code taken from a prior class assignment were converted to text files. These text files should be used for the comparisons
